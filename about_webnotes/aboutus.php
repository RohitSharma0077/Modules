	<h1><b>Platform To Learn And Create</b></h1>

		
		
		<p><i>
			It started when two friends sitting in restaurant having brunch.They discussed about their problems that they were faced when they join college for bachelor of computer science degree.Now they are in third year of  their degree.<br><br> So one of the friend  explain what he had experience and what problems he had faced,while disscussing the problems,an  idea stuck in their mind.Why not they made an interface which helps the students to learn and used for the teaching purpose  too . So that the problem which were faced by us will not be faced by any student.<br><br>So we started observing that what problem faced by their friends in the class and get their feedbacks and started working on the design.After doing so many modifications we create a design which helps to learn and create whatever you want.</i>
